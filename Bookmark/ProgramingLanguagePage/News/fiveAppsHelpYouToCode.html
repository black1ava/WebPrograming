              The best thing about this app is the many choices of coding you can learn. From HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and other- this app offers courses taught by industry leaders from places like Google and Facebook. The app is free for many of the courses, but if you opt for the premium version of the app- you can gain access to feedback from those in their field and connect with other's learning how to code as well. This is more than a platform to learn, but it helps build a community and make connections with those interested in coding. Some of the premium courses recently released can actually teach you how to build artificial intelligence as well, but can be a bit pricey ranging from $1000-$2400 a course.

            SoloLearn is best for those who have no prior coding knowledge and want to start from the beginning. Each section is broken up by "chapters" that you learn and test on. At the end of each chapter, you are quizzed on your knowledge and must receive a passing score to move onto the next chapter. It works much like a college online course where you can participate in forums with other students and ask questions about things you may be confused on. There are hundreds of different quizzes and activities in the code playground section to keep practicing.
