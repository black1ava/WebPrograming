            Created by Microsoft, C# is considered to be one of the most powerful programming languages in the Dot NET framework. It is a powerful, flexible language that gives you a comprehensive programming foundation which is applicable to Java, Objective-C, PHP, and more. You can think of C# as a blend of the C++ and the Java language but Anders Hejlsberg, the creator of C#, says the language is more like C++ than Java.
